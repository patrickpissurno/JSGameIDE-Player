# JSGameIDE Player
This is the repo where the Windows Player (SDK) is developed. Main project repo: http://patrickpissurno.github.io/JSGameIDE/
###JSGameIDE requires Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 in order to run.
####Please ensure that it is properly installed, otherwise many bugs and crashes may appear. Download link: https://www.microsoft.com/pt-br/download/details.aspx?id=17851

##How to use
Download [this .zip](https://github.com/patrickpissurno/JSGameIDE-Player/archive/master.zip) and copy all the contents into a folder named 'SDK' inside the program directory. If the folder does not exists, just create it. The .sln file and all the other files must be placed inside the SDK folder, without the JSGameIDE-Player-master folder. Then, download the [packages.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByZImqmnJbREb2lCWnEwanRQUUU/view?usp=sharing) file and extract its content to the root of the 'SDK' folder.

It should look like this:
